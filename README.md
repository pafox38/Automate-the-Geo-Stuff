# Automate the Geo Stuff
## Useful code for geoscientists / geologists in the energy sector
 * las curve mnemonic aliasing.
 * las API Change.  This program will parse through a folder full of las files and standardize API numbers and output new files with the new API number as the file name.  This makes bulk loading into G&G software much easier.  Additional if/elif and Exceptions can be added if other formats are discovered.
 * Directory file search based on file extension.  Useful when looking for pesky las files.
 * Violin plot to illustrate a cross-sectional view of wellbore targeting.  Simple gun barrel plots illustrate an idealized view of post-drill wellbore targeting.  The use of violin plots provides the user to communicate WHERE the wellbore traversed in adjacent formations/units.  Utilizes data exported from geosteering software.
